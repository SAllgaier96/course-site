```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```

By now, we realize that the bootstrap is a powerful and flexible method. However,
it does have downsides, specifically when estimating values in the extremes. For
example, consider 1000 samples drawn from a uniform distribution between 0 and 2.

```{r}
theta <- 2
x <- runif(1000, min = 0, max = theta)
```

Given these samples, we'd like to estimate `theta`.

```{r}
n_samples <- 10000
bs_theta <- replicate(n_samples, max(sample(x, replace = TRUE)))
```

```{r}
hist(bs_theta)
```

What do we notice about the distribution of our estimates of `theta`?

```{r}
max(x)
```

```{r}
max(bs_theta)
```

Let's build a confidence interval around our estimate of `theta`.

```{r}
quantile(bs_theta, c(0.025, 0.975))
```

Oh no!! Our confidence interval *does not* include the true value. Why?
