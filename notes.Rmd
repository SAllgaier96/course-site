*Obedience opens the door to the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost. And 
the spiritual gifts and abilities activated by the power of the Holy Ghost enable 
us to avoid deception—and to see, to feel, to know, to understand, and to remember 
things as they really are. You and I have been endowed with a greater capacity for 
obedience precisely for these reasons.*

*I testify that his intelligence is vastly superior in every field to the very 
brightest mortals in those fields and that his intellect in scope and truth far 
exceeds all human intellects. I thank him for encapsulating that exquisite mind 
in both perfect love and perfect humility. His brilliance is not the 
“catch-me-if-you-can” kind, but a pleading and patient, “Come, follow me.”*

+ Introduction to simulation studies:
  + "Simulation study" and "Monte Carlo study" are synonymous.
  + Represent a real-world process programatically in order to evaluate statistical
  properties
  + Uses include:
    + Describing distributions (e.g., mean, variance, quantiles).
    + Evaluating point estimators.
    + Evaluating confidence intervals.
    + Investigating the properties and performance of testing hypothesis procedures.
    + Checking the finite-sample statistical properties of estimators and testing 
    procedures that have been motivated through asymptotics.
    + and many others...
  + Especially useful when theoretical derivations are unavailable, difficult, 
    or intractable.
