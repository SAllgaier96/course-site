+ Introduction to simulation studies:
  + "Simulation study" and "Monte Carlo study" are synonymous.
  + Represent a real-world process programatically in order to evaluate statistical
  properties
  + Uses include:
    + Describing distributions (e.g., mean, variance, quantiles).
    + Evaluating point estimators.
    + Evaluating confidence intervals.
    + Investigating the properties and performance of testing hypothesis procedures.
    + Checking the finite-sample statistical properties of estimators and testing 
    procedures that have been motivated through asymptotics.
    + and many others...
  + Especially useful when theoretical derivations are unavailable, difficult, 
    or intractable.
