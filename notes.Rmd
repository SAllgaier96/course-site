*I testify that his intelligence is vastly superior in every field to the very 
brightest mortals in those fields and that his intellect in scope and truth far 
exceeds all human intellects. I thank him for encapsulating that exquisite mind 
in both perfect love and perfect humility. His brilliance is not the 
“catch-me-if-you-can” kind, but a pleading and patient, “Come, follow me.”*

\- Neal A. Maxwell ([GC April 1976](https://www.lds.org/general-conference/1976/04/jesus-of-nazareth-savior-and-king?lang=eng))

  properties
  + Uses include:
    + Describing distributions (e.g., mean, variance, quantiles).
    + Evaluating point estimators.
    + Evaluating confidence intervals.
    + Investigating the properties and performance of testing hypothesis procedures.
    + Checking the finite-sample statistical properties of estimators and testing 
    procedures that have been motivated through asymptotics.
    + and many others...
  + Especially useful when theoretical derivations are unavailable, difficult, 
    or intractable.
